# Recon

This project is for my University MSc in Applied computer science.

In a digital world where the internet forms part of a daily lives and technology is now a principal part of our communication as well as economic and social activity.  It is more apparent than ever that the security and protection of these technologies is critical to our way of life. 

Information Security and Ethical Hacking is not only my means of employment, but it is also a hobby and something that I have always been passionate about.  It is also what got me interested the MSc Applied Computer Science.   

This project will aim to create a network mapping and reconnaissance tool commonly known as a Network Scanner.  The scanner will investigate and show open ports on a devices and map network topologies.  This will enable network administrators to better understand their estates and assist Penetration Testers in finding vulnerabilities. 

As my goal is to create my own security tool, rather than using other developer’s applications and scripts, It will enable me to improve my programming skills and my understanding on how the tools work in the background. 

I have decided that as part of the project I would like to create something a little different and once again try out a new langage and technology that I haven’t used so far in MSc. 

Insperation has been taken from Nmap and SPARTA projects.
